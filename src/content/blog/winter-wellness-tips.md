As winter approaches, it's important to adjust our health routines to stay well during the colder months. Here are evidence-based strategies to keep you and your family healthy all season long.

## Boost Your Immune System

Winter is prime time for colds and flu. Support your immune system with:
- Adequate sleep (7-9 hours for adults)
- Regular exercise, even indoors
- Vitamin D supplementation
- Balanced nutrition rich in fruits and vegetables

## Stay Active Despite the Cold

Don't let winter weather derail your fitness routine. Indoor activities like swimming, yoga, and gym workouts can keep you moving when it's too cold outside.

## Combat Seasonal Affective Disorder

Shorter days can affect mood. Consider light therapy, maintain social connections, and don't hesitate to seek professional support if needed.
