## Why Mental Health Matters

Mental health is an integral part of overall health and well-being. Just as we care for our physical bodies, our minds deserve the same attention and care.

### Common Mental Health Conditions

Understanding these conditions helps reduce stigma and encourages people to seek help:

**Depression** — Persistent sadness, loss of interest, changes in sleep and appetite

**Anxiety Disorders** — Excessive worry, panic attacks, phobias

**Bipolar Disorder** — Alternating periods of mania and depression

**PTSD** — Following traumatic events, causing flashbacks and hypervigilance

**OCD** — Intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors

## Recognizing the Warning Signs

Early intervention is crucial. Watch for:

### Emotional Changes

- Appetite changes (eating too much or too little)
- Decreased energy or motivation

### Cognitive Changes

Structure provides stability and reduces anxiety:
