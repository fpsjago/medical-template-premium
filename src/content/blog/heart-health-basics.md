## The Foundation of Heart Health

Your heart is one of the most vital organs in your body, pumping blood and oxygen to every cell. Understanding how to care for it is essential for long-term health and longevity.

### Key Risk Factors

Several factors can increase your risk of heart disease:

- **High blood pressure** — Often called the "silent killer"
- **High cholesterol** — Can lead to arterial blockage
- **Smoking** — Damages blood vessels and reduces oxygen
- **Diabetes** — Affects blood vessel health
- **Obesity** — Increases strain on the heart
- **Physical inactivity** — Weakens cardiovascular fitness

## Prevention Through Lifestyle

### 1. Regular Exercise

Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity per week. This can include:

- Brisk walking
- Swimming
- Cycling
- Dancing
- Jogging

### 2. Heart-Healthy Diet

Focus on:

- Fruits and vegetables
- Whole grains
- Lean proteins
- Omega-3 fatty acids
- Limited saturated fats and sodium

### 3. Stress Management

Chronic stress can negatively impact heart health. Practice:

- Meditation
- Deep breathing exercises
- Yoga
- Adequate sleep (7-9 hours)
- Regular relaxation activities

## When to See a Cardiologist

Schedule an appointment if you experience:

- Chest pain or discomfort
- Shortness of breath
- Irregular heartbeat
- Persistent fatigue
- Swelling in legs or feet

### Regular Screenings

**Age 20+:** Blood pressure checks every 2 years
**Age 40+:** Cholesterol screening every 4-6 years
**Age 50+:** Annual comprehensive cardiovascular assessment

## The Bottom Line

Heart health is a lifelong commitment. Small, consistent changes in diet, exercise, and stress management can significantly reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease. Work closely with your healthcare provider to develop a personalized prevention plan.

*Remember: It's never too early or too late to start taking care of your heart.*
